# Output

_Selected subset of pipeline output that would be immediately relevant to the reader. Provide the reader with as much as they could reasonably be interested in, but avoid including large files in a git repository._

_For projects that use BioLockJ, the final completed pipeline can stored here. Many files may be deleted (including many outputs) but the structure of modules' outputs, logs and scripts provides organization._
