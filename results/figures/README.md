# Assembled Figures

The (near) final publication figures.  These often include manual annotations.  It is recommended to include the corresponding figure legend as a readme or as individual files.  Resist the temptation to put figure numbers in the file names until you actually hit the submit button. Use concise but meaningful names throughout the development of the manuscript.

The generic example shown here comes from the well known iris data set.

Notice that the figure legend is also stored here as a markdown document.  This format is very conducive to git, easy to read as plain text, renders on github with nice formatting, and is easy to incorporate into other markdown documents, like the review that we recommend you include at the end of your pipeline.
